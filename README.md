  <summary>1. What is Angular Framework?</summary>
<p>
  Angular is an application-design framework and development platform for creating efficient and sophisticated single-page apps
</p>
<p>
  Angular is a development platform, built on Typescript. As a platform, Angular incudes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A component-based framework for building scalable web applications</li>
<li>A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication and more</li>
<li>A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code</li>
</ul>
<p>
With Angular, you are taking advantage of a platform 
that can scale form single-developer projects to enterprise-level 
applications. Angular is design to make updating as straightforward as possible,
so take advantage of the last developments with minimal effort. Best of all, the Angular
ecosystem consists of a diverse group of over 1.7 million developers, library
authors, and content creators.
